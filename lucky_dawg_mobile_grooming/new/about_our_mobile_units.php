		<h1>About Our Mobile Units</h1>
		<p>Our modern Mobile grooming vans are fully equipped and self sufficient with all the equipment that a professional groomer requires. We just need to connect our electrical cord to an electrical outlet at your house or office and were ready to start the grooming process.</p>
		<p><strong>75 gallons of clean fresh water</strong> is plumbed to an efficient water heater system that provides plenty of warm water for deep cleansing and relaxing baths.</p>
		<p><strong>The advance ventilation system</strong> provides all year round comfort for the groomer and youâ€™re pet.</p>
		<p><strong>The halogen interior lighting system</strong> coupled with wonderful sunlight from the sky lights provides bright illumination in the working areas allowing the groomer to see every detail and the smallest of hairs.</p>
		<p><strong>The electrically operated grooming table</strong> raises and lowers to accommodate all breeds large or small and allows the groomer to work at a comfortable height. Pets simply step onto the table, are raised up to grooming height, and walk across a platform into the tub.</p>
		<p><strong>Efficient force air dryers.</strong> We use the most efficient dryers available with variable speed and heat functionality, gently drying and fluffing the coat of your pet.</p>
		<p><strong>Our Taxi Vac Grooming System</strong> means a cleaner and healthier grooming environment and a smoother hair cut for your pet. The quiet air flow keeps the trimming blades cool whilst suctioning hair, dander and fleas directly into the trash.</p>
		<p>Often, clients viewing the interiors of our vans for the first time comment that it looks like a vet's office or a small medical room. Clinically looking in appearance, bright, clean and spacious. We are proud of our vans and keeping them in top condition is important to us.</p>
