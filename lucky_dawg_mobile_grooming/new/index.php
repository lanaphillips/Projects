		<h2>Why Use Lucky Dog Mobile Grooming?</h2>
		<h3 class="green">Convenience of Course!</h3>
		<p>Lucky Dawg Mobile Pet Grooming comes to your home or office at an agreed appointment time. This eliminates the hassle of you having to drop your pet off at a grooming shop early in the morning, only to have to return again later in the afternoon to pick up your pet. Unpredictable traffic and the tension of travel with your pet are avoided. Mobile grooming is the most convenient way to groom your pet allowing you more time to for other important activities. By special arrangements you don’t even have to be at home when we come to groom your pet. You can come home from work to a clean, cute and happy pet.</p>
		<h3 class="green">Less Stress on You and Your Pet!</h3>
		<p>Unlike most grooming salon’s because we come to you, your pet is never exposed to other pets, and is never caged surrounded by barking, aggressive dogs and stressing for several hours without food or water. We do not use cages, in our modern fully equipped mobile salons. Whether your pet is a cat or dog you can be assured that it will receive individual personal attention by a professional caring groomer in a calm, clean, safe environment and with most grooming taking about an hour, your pet will be back home in no time looking and feeling great.</p>
		<h3 class="green">Health and Safety is Our Priority</h3>
		<p>Because Lucky Dawg Mobile Pet Grooming comes to you, your pet is never exposed to other pets that may potentially be harboring infectious disease or parasites. Inside our modern mobile salons the equipment and surfaces are cleaned and disinfected after each grooming. Our groomers also prefer to work in a tidy, clean and sanitized relaxed environment. We use natural organic professional grooming products that are safe, environmentally friendly and help maintain and keep your pet looking and feeling great.</p>
		<h3 class="green">The Grooming Process Takes About an Hour!</h3>

We only groom one pet at a time so your pet receives individual caring attention from start to finish. Your pet will receive a comprehensive grooming procedure. We hand fluff dry our pets using a variable force dryer, we never cage our pets. The hand drying method is particularly effective with dogs that shed, by loosening and removing excess undercoat.</p>
