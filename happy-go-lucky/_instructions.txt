Hi website updator. You are Totaly awesome for reading this.
So here's some instructions to keeping this website AWESOME!

1) Please, please, please put items where they belong. All
   photos belong in the images folder. Seriously, ALL of them.
   If you want to get organized in the images folder, make a
   folder inside of images. 

   EX: images > testimonials > imagename.jpg

2) If you have something you're working on, like a testimonials
   page update, place it in the workdesk folder. If you want to
   check it out on your site, go to...

   happygoluckypetcare.com/workdesk/pagename.html

3) If you update your page and something looks broken, go to
   http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload. If you 
   know anything about html, this will tell you what's 
   broken and where. Also, check the css!

4) DO NOT use microsoft word to update your website! Use a text
   editor like textmate or notepad (windows). Better yet,
   use Sublime Text. It's free!

5) Optimize your images! File size on photos is super important,
   and can make the difference between a photo taking a split-second
   to load, or a second or two. I don't recommend using gifs.
   Use a .png (maintains transparency) or .jpg/.jpeg and run them through...
