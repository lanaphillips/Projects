						<h2>What results and benefits can I expect from daily dog walking?</h2>
						<div class="details">
							<p>You can expect a happy and healthy dog. Knowing your dog is receiving the exercise attention they deserve will provide you with relief of stress and guilt over leaving them. Daily exercise is essential to your dogs physical well-being, but also prevents them from getting mentally tired. This is especially the case for most of our dogs that live with us in apartments. A restless dog will become irritable and begin to destroy your belongings out of boredom or just looking for excitement. We guarantee you will see a change for the better in your dog if you use our regular walking service.</p>
