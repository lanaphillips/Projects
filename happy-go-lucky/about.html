				<p><strong>Paula Rego’s</strong> love for animals began early on her family farm. She would often bring home wounded animals and nurse them back to health. Over the years Paula continued animal rescue work. This included caring for a special needs dog rescued from Maddie’s Adoption Center in San Francisco.</p>
				<p>Before founding Happy Go Lucky Pet Care&trade;, Paula had a career in the restaurant industry as a Special Events Manager and General Manager. On her days off you would often find her pet sitting for friends and family. This naturally evolved into her co-founding Happy Go Lucky Pet Care&trade;. In her free time Paula enjoys volunteering in animal rescue, hiking, snowboarding and spending time with her own pets.</p>
				<p><strong>Lisa Ronan</strong> is a bay-area native who wouldn’t dream of living anywhere else. Her love for animals blossomed as a young girl when she fostered her neighbor’s dog when she had a litter of seventeen puppies. Lisa was there to feed and bathe all of them until each one was adopted.</p>
				<p>Lisa holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and a minor in Management Information Systems. Before co-founding Happy Go Lucky Pet Care&trade; Lisa had a career as a Business Analyst for a large Fortune 100 Company. In her free time Lisa enjoys spending time outdoors and fostering homeless pets before they can be adopted in their forever home.</p>
				<p>We provide dog walking and pet sitting for the following cities: Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Alamo and Pleasant Hill.</p>
