                    <h1><span>About</span></h1>
                    <p>Hello. My name is Nancy Duncan. I started <strong>My Furry Friend </strong>as a pet sitting service in 1997. I believed then as I do now that the best job in the world is spending time with cats. I have had my own furry friends for most of my adult life and have come to understand their unique ways of interacting with each other and those in their environment. I have shared in the playfulness of their early years and cared for them when they became ill in their later years. I bring the value of this experience to every cat placed in my care and I fully understand the importance of knowing oneâ€™s pet is in trusted, knowledgeable and loving hands.</p>
                    <p>Prior to starting <strong>My Furry Friend</strong>, I spent many years as a volunteer with the San Francisco SPCA. I began as a cat adoption counselor helping to find homes for the homeless and then moved on to become a shelter behaviorist. This entailed socializing the more aggressive and withdrawn cats to facilitate their adoptions. During this time I completed my graduate degree in psychology and counseling at the University of San Francisco. My education and interest in cat behavior led me to become a member of the nationally recognized team of SPCA Cat Behaviorists, providing telephone consultations and counseling for pet owners throughout the United States whose cats were experiencing a wide range of behavior problems. In 2007 I joined the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants and became an Associate Certified Cat Behaviorist in 2009. My background and training allow me to bring a unique set of skills to my business and my work as a Cat Behaviorist. As a licensed psychotherapist, I evaluate and address the problems exhibited by cats not only from the feline perspective but also in relation to their home environment and their relationship with all family members.</p>
                    <p>My area of expertise as a psychotherapist is in the area of loss and grief. So that I could provide support specific to pet loss, in 2010 I earned my certification as a Professional Pet Loss Counselor through the Association of Pet Loss and Bereavement.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Furry Friend</strong> is owner operated, a member of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement, the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters, and is fully licensed, bonded and insured. Training to administer pet first aid and CPR has been completed. All services are personalized to meet the needs of both pets and owners. Pet sitting is provided throughout most of San Francisco. Although we specialize in cats, we are happy to care for other small animals such as birds, fish and bunnies. Behavioral Consultations are conducted via an in home visit throughout much of the Bay Area or via telephone. References provided upon request.</p>
