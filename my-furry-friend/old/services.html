        <p class="underline"><strong>PET SITTING</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Initial Consultation: </strong>An initial consultation is required for all new clients. This provides an opportunity 
          for us to meet and for you to introduce me to your pets and home. I complete a pet profile gathering 
          all the information needed to care for your pets including medical history and emergency contacts. 
          We complete a written contract confirming pet care services, dates of service and payment. </p>
        <p><strong>Visits: </strong>Daily visits are provided in your home. Each visit includes providing fresh food and water, 
          litter box cleaning, and whatever else your pets enjoy. This can range from playtime, grooming, 
          love and affection, conversation or simply good company.  Home services include mail and 
          newspaper pickup, plant watering, putting out and bringing in garbage bins, and rotating lights on 
          and off  for additional security. Yard watering can be arranged for an additional fee. A daily journal 
          is kept to update you of your pet&rsquo;s activities upon your return home.</p>
        <p><strong>Medications: </strong>Pilling, administering fluids and giving shots are available services for those with special 
          health needs. Additional fees may apply. Services may be limited based upon your pet&rsquo;s temperament.</p>
        <p><strong>Keys: </strong>Keys to your home are given to me at the initial consultation meeting. Most clients prefer to 
          have their keys kept on file for future service. If you require your keys to be returned, there will be a 
          charge for key drop off and future pickup.</p>
        <p><strong>Rates:</strong> Standard visits, including the initial consultation, range from $25.00 to $30.00 <br />
          Fees for service are payable in advance with the exception of extended trips or by special arrangement.
          Please be aware that prices may vary based upon the size of your pet family and special needs.
          A surcharge applies to visits provided during certain holidays.</p>
        <p><strong>Cancellation Policy: </strong>Cancellations made less than 48 hours in advance of the beginning service date 
          are subject to a 100% cancellation fee. Holiday reservations require a 5 day notice of cancellation to 
          avoid a 100% cancellation fee. Some exceptions may apply.</p>
        <p class="underline"><strong>Additional Services </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Pet Taxi: </strong>Services include visits to the vet and the groomer.</p>
        <p><strong>Supply Runs: </strong>Services include medication and prescription food pick up from the vet and visits to the 
          pet store to pick up food and other supplies. These services are available during pet sitting 
          engagements as well as when you are in town.</p>
        <p><strong>Emergency Services:</strong> Based upon need.</p>
        <p>*Rates for additional services are made by special arrangement depending upon the circumstances.</p>
