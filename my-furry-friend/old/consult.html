        <p class="underline"><strong>The Consultation Process</strong></p>
        <p>Consultations are scheduled by appointment only. Prior to scheduling, I will conduct a brief telephone 
          interview to discuss the nature of the problem and efforts which have been made to correct it. A 
          veterinary examination may be required to rule out a medical cause. </p>
        <p>Behavior problems are often your cat&rsquo;s way of communicating a problem. The key is to uncover the 
          cause of the problem as seen through the eyes and mind of your cat. This can best be achieved 
          through an in home visit to evaluate the home environment and observe your cat in his or her natural 
          territory. It is recommended that all family members be present in order to see how your cat and 
          family members interact and to understand how each member views the problem. Telephone 
          consultations are conducted when distance is a limiting factor.<br />
          <br />
          During the consultation I will gather information about your cat&rsquo;s personality and life history, recent 
          changes or stressors to his or her environment and details regarding the undesirable behavior. The 
          consultation will range from one to one and a half hours and conclude with a diagnosis of the problem 
          and initial suggestions to treat it. I will provide a written treatment plan within one week of the 
          consultation which could include modification suggestions for family members as well as your cat. 
          Follow up telephone calls or emails to monitor progress, suggest additional interventions and provide 
          ongoing support will be available on an as needed basis for a defined period of time. This can include 
          working with your vet, as sometimes the problem is best addressed through a combination of behavior
          modification and medication. The probability of successfully resolving the problem will greatly depend 
          upon your flexibility, consistency in following the treatment plan, and the personality and temperament
          of your cat.</p>
        <p><strong class="underline">Rates</strong><br />
          Consultation fees will be provided after the initial telephone interview and prior to scheduling an 
          appointment. Hourly rates will apply if additional service is requested after the consultation and follow 
          up period.</p>
