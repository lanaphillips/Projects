					<h2>Jackie Pekar</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="details">
					<p>Jackie Pekar established SouthPaw Pet Sitting in 2005 after recognizing a need in her community for loving, quality pet care. She had always been an avid pet lover, and wanted the pets of Akron to be able to enjoy the creature comforts of home while their owners are away-- after all, her current menagerie of 4 dogs and two cats much preferred the sights, sounds and smells of her own home in West Akron! Her philosophy is simple:  provide the best care possible for her clientsâ€™ pets.  Jackie regularly attends lectures and conferences to stay informed of the latest in pet care, behavior, and nutrition information. Jackie and her team of devoted pet care professionals look forward to meeting with you and your pets!</p>

					<h2>Timothy Aber</h2>

				<div class="details">
					<p>Tim and his wife Patty hired SouthPaw several years ago to care for their half dozen pets when they took a west coast vacation. They were impressed that Jackie didn`t mind indulging their almost daily "check-in" calls.</p>
					<p>When Tim decided to retire from Nursing after 31 years as an OR Nurse he inquired about working for Jackie in her growing business.</p>
					<p>He found out how gratifying it is to be able to provide for the customer`s furry family members as he would want his own cared for.</p>

					<h2>Cathy Schneider</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="details">
					<p>Cathy was also a client of SouthPaw Pet Sitting... Jackie had cared for her 3 standard poodles while she was a teacher in Cleveland.  Cathy retired, and joined the SouthPaw team during the summer of 2012. </p>
					<p>She enjoys working in her yard and walking her dogs thru her West Akron neighborhood.  Many a dog and cat have been spoiled by Cathy's gentle and loving care. From Cathy: "Throughout my life I found nothing more enjoyable then working with and taking care of animals. I understand how meaningful our relationships can be with our pets, and the importance of exceptional pet care."</p>
