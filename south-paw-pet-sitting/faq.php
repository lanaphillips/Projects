				<div class="question"><h2>How do I set up pet care with SouthPaw Pet Sitting?</h2></div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>First step is to schedule a meet-n-greet with us, and fill out a house &amp; pet profile form. We’ll ask you questions about your pets’ routine, location of food and supplies, get a layout of the house, and veterinary information. We’ll also need emergency contact numbers. The meet-n-greet usually takes around 30-45 minutes. At this time we’ll get a key and tag it with your pets’ names. </p>
					<p>Second step? Book your visits! Most clients prefer to leave their key on file with us, so scheduling is a breeze. Key pick-up and drop off is available, for an additional charge.</p>
