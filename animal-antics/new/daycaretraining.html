		        <h2>Training</h2>
				<p>The Animal Antics training philosophy is part of our holistic focus on good mental and physical health for pets. We believe that by showing animals the same love and respect that they freely give us, we establish healthy bonds important to successful training. By sharing with you our knowledge about communication and the wonders of animal behavior, we help you to develop a pet relationship that is a source of joy, and based on trust. </p>
				<p>Training should be fun for both human and animal learners, should communicate mutual respect, and should inspire the learning process. Our gentle, cooperative approach teaches socialization skills, modifies problem behaviors, and is the basis of our full spectrum of obedience classes. </p>
				<p>All of our classes are taught using Clicker Training. This method is quick, effective, hands-free, force-free, and easy to use for all family members. Clicker training also produces better, longer-lasting results and enthusiastic learners. Best of all, your pet will love to work with you!</p>
				<h5>Clicker Training for Desired Behavior - Simple, straightforward, and easy to use</h5>
				<p>Clicker Training is a method that uses a 'marker signal' to tell an animal when they have accomplished the desired behavior. By pairing the behavior with a 'click,' and then following up with something the animal wants (treats, toys, petting, play), the animal will learn to repeat actions that produce enjoyable results.  </p>
				<p>Traditional training focuses on suppressing bad behavior. Clicker Training is different - the trainer focuses on rewarding good behavior, without using force or fear. Through cooperation, respect, and fun, Clicker Training deepens and enhances our relationships with our pets. </p> 
				<p>Clicker Training produces creativity, accelerates learning, and creates enthusiastic learners because the methodology stimulates your pet's thinking and relies on your pet interacting with you!</p>
				<p>Our Classes</p>
				<p>Class goals are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Learn the fundamentals of Clicker Training.</li>
				  <li>Build a training relationship based in fun and love of learning.</li>
				  <li>Eliminate problem behaviors. </li>
				  <li>Establish effective, life-long communication with your pet.</li>
				</ul>
